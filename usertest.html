    <h1>User test</h1>
    <p>Are the colors working? Is it easy to read?</p>
    <p>I really like the colors I think it matches well with the subject (your cat) so i don’t think no further changes can be made with it however I think I will suggest to maybe add colors when hovering on to something.</p>
    <p>Other than the layout for overlay, what should I work on more?</p>
    <p>I think you should add more interactivity on it to make it more engaging perhaps adding doodles or texts or graphics maybe the images change effects and all when users hover onto like the images or when they click onto them</p>
    <p>Tell me something that you feel it was confusing</p>
    <p>Overall everythings works well I just wished maybe there’s more information about your cat to know them more if that makes sense perhaps add like a description on some pictures and stuff (unless you already plan to do so) otherwise it looks interesting</p>
