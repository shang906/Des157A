            <p>This is the first image that makes me look handsome that my sister take. I feel like although she was trying to get a good image of me. But till, this moment, this is the first time I liked my picture. So I have decided to think this as the first picture of me arriving home.</p>

            <p>This is my first time I was able to go out! I was so excited. I was a little affaid that my parents would dump me. But gladly, they were just bringing me outside to know more about the environment. I really enjoyed the time was out. I totally got in love with the grass and I would love to go out more. But I did not like the time I spent in the thing bought me to the park. I think my parents and sister were calling it a car. But I don't quite understand what it means yet.</p>

        <p>Professor Housefield is my favorite professor in the world. I feel like there is so much to learn from him. It is so fun to listen to his DES 001. I learned all my basic design concept and information from him. I usually would like to take notes within his class as well. I feel like there are so much for me to memorize. I can't wait if I can get to fly to US and meet him in person.</p>

        <p>I am waiting for my sister to go to bed with me. I don't know what she is up to recently. She always stay up all night and talk to her computer. I feel like she like the computer more than me know. I want to close her computer and make her play with me. I am too tired of staying at the back of the screen. I would want to go to bed. Good night sister.</p>

        <p>Look at my new car! I liked this car more. I get to know more about what a car is. It is something that can get me to everywhere I want. That is how my mom gets me to the park. I feel like this new car matches my style. It makes me look so handsome. Hope I can get to drive it someday!</p>
