            <article>I feel like I learned a lot from the reading that is talking about how dialogy window is working. I have not thought about how much influence there could be when the dialogy window are diffrent and how much influence it can bring to people when they are viewing the website. I should think about a dialogy window can give people a better experience when they are looking at the webstie as the designer. I should always keep in mind that it is always important to give my readers a good experience and be user friendly for them when I am creating a website. Also, it is important for me to remember the difference that a exit window can bring to the readers. I should keep in mind that I should always use it carefully and be careful about what I am doing.</article>

            <article>By looking into the best practice of design, one broad idea that I have found is that there are many minor things that could influence the outcome of one website. In order to make a website that is user friendly and easy to read, as the designers we need to guide the users on every single step so that they can fully understand what are they being expected to be putting in when they are submitting a form. One really interesting thing that I found when I was reading the article is how there should not be a refresh button being set on the website. I would usually think that would be the first thing that I would try since it would be easier to have some feedback, but as the designer, it is important to remember how it would influence others and how it might not be the best solution.</article>

                I have never thought about how much a picture can tell. I did not think about the effect it has. I always thought it as something that can show what was going on at that time or something that helps people understand the word. I never thought about how much details a picture can bring. But thinking about how people would use it as evidence at crime scene, it makes sense that how much it can bring. It seems like when I take more time to read into the picture, there would be more that I can get from it. So it is important to practice that skill. Then as a web designer, I should make sure people are getting what I am trying to address instead of other things.
